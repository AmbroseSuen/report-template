Descriptions of the Invention
=============================

Data Verification is one of the customized features of openBIM Checker where cross checking is automatically conducted to verify the consistency between the conventional design drawings and the BIM models.

In Figure 1, openBIM Checker is able to load the design data of socket H-piles from both conventional design drawings in PDF format and the BIM model in IFC format. These two sets of design data are displayed horizontally. By clicking the “Cross Check” button, the discrepant data such as pile bearing capacity is identified and highlighted in red color instantly.

In Figure 2, openBIM Checker is also able to generate a discrepancy report in spreadsheet format which all the discrepant data is clearly marked and highlighted.

This Data Verification feature is time-saving and care-free to the users who do not have to set rules in the software for the compliance check process. By few mouse clicks, the users are able to identify the discrepant data and generate a discrepancy report easily.

The other customized feature of openBIM Checker is Model Inspector which enables the users to search what they need in the BIM models with minimum effort. By a single-click button, the users are easily to make quick selection for the major types of model elements and filter out the required data from the model objects.

In Figure 3,  openBIM Checker provides a series of tailor made icons where users are able to easily select the common types of structure elements such as transfer beam and cantilevered beam with a single-click. These common structure elements are named based on the common terminologies adopted in local AEC industry.

In Figure 4, openBIM Checker is able to highlight the selected cantilevered beams in the BIM model with the data label tied to each model object. Users are easily to visualize the selected model objects in the first place.  If further inspection to object data is needed, users are able to use the Level/ Location Filter and Properties Filter to find what they want to see.

With the Model Viewer feature, users do not need to have intensive training or complicated workflow to visualize the model objects and the associated data. After all, openBIM Checker definitely saves the time and effort for the users.
