3. Background
=============

openBIM Checker is a combination of two distinctive features which are user-centered design and vendor-natural platform. Such combination creates the uniqueness of this invention.

At the time this software being developed, the proprietary software for checking BIM model like Solibri typically provides generic rules for design compliance check such as clearance in front of a door and height of a barrier, etc. However, these generic rules may not be able to cover the local regulations or code of practice. In this case, users may consider creating customized rules by themselves through the proprietary software. However, that brings inconvenience to the users as they need to spend a considerable amount of time for rule setting and testing. 

In addition, the proprietary software only provides design compliance check within the BIM model itself.  However, as far as prescribed plan approval is concerned, the local authorities may require checking the consistency between the conventional design drawings against the BIM model when the design consultants submit both the conventional design drawings and BIM models for approval. Hence, the proprietary software may not able to satisfy the local authoritiesâ€™ need in this case.

openBIM Checker is designed to suit the need of the local authorities by introducing customized features including Data Verification and Model Inspector.

Moreover, openBIM Checker is a vendor-natural platform which accepts Industry Foundation Classes (IFC). IFC is one of the open data format promoted by buildingSMART International. Therefore, openBIM Checker enables the local authorities to embrace the principles and benefits of openBIM in respect to long-term interoperable data standards and reliable data exchanges.
